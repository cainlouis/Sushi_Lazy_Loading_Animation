# Introduction

__Look at the material below with the goal of broad understanding__. You don't 
have to understand or remember all the details, just the big ideas.

* Write down questions that come to mind.
* Take high-level notes.

# Concepts

These are the keywords you should pay most attention to:

* render-blocking resources
* critical resources
* media query
* lazy loading
* IntersectionObserver
* asynchronous loading of CSS
* image `srcset` attribute
* lab performance data 
* real user monitoring (RUM)
* `import`, `export`, `default export`, `as`

# Tasks

Read the following:

* Optimize resource loading
  * [Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading)
  * [Image lazy loading approaches](https://web.dev/lazy-loading-images/) - read the sections on browser-level and IntersectionObserver
  * [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) - read until "How intersection is calculated"
  * [Defer non-critical CSS](https://web.dev/defer-non-critical-css/)
* Client-side tools
  * [Overview of various tools](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/speed-tools/)
* Modules
  * [ECMAScript Modules(ESM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) (read upto Modules and classes)
  * Skim over very quickly: [CommonJS Modules](https://code-trotter.com/web/understand-the-different-javascript-modules-formats/) - read CommonJS and ES2015 Modules(ESM) sections only. We will see some libraries using CJS only when we start back-end programming
