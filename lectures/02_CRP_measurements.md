## How the Browser Works

---

### Navigation

* HTTP GET Request sent 
  * e.g. HTTP GET `http://blah.com/index.html`
* Network communication setup:
  * Mobile handshake, TCP handshake
  * DNS look-up (`blah.com`)
  * TLS negotiation (if HTTPS)

---

* HTTP GET Response received
  * message header has important information, such as the content-type
  * message body contains the html source code of `index.html`
  * _Time to first byte_ (TTFB) measures time until first packet received
  * the response may need multiple TCP packets
  * _TCP slow start_ - first response packet is 14kb
    * each subsequent packet is doubled until reach threshold/congestion

---

### Critical Rendering Path

As soon as the first packet of the HTML file is received, the browser starts parsing the HTML, and building the DOM. 

DOM construction is incremental.

---

The browser initiates a network request when it finds a link to an external resource (css, js, images, fonts, ...). 

The **preload scanner** will in fact request  high priority resources *before* the HTML parser reaches them. So a script linked at the end of the file will be downloaded earlier. 

::: notes

Some resource requests are blocking = HTML parsing stops while the response is handled

### DOM

---

### DOM and CSSOM

Once the DOM is complete (i.e., html parsed), the CSSOM is constructed. 

The CSSOM *cannot* be constructed incrementally, because styles can overwrite each other. 

---

CSS is render-blocking: nothing is rendered until *all* the CSS is parsed and the CSSOM is complete. 

::: notes

"The CSS object model gets built as the CSS is parsed, but can't be used to build the render tree until it is completely parsed because styles that are going to be overwritten with later parsing should not be rendered to the screen." [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path)

:::

---

More specific rules (i.e., `section div.warning`) are less performant when creating the CSSOM than less specific (`section`).

The more selectors, the longer to traverse the DOM to create the CSSOM.

::: notes

"The more specific rule is more expensive because it has to traverse more nodes in the DOM tree - but that extra expense is generally minimal. Measure first. Optimize as needed. Specificity is likely not your low hanging fruit. When it comes to CSS, selector performance optimization, improvements will only be in microseconds. There are other ways to optimize CSS, such as minification, and separating deferred CSS into non-blocking requests by using media queries." [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path)

### CSSOM

---

### JavaScript compilation

While CSS is being parsed, JavaScript is interpreted and compiled. 

Yes, JavaScript is compiled! 

For faster code execution, byte code is used; compilation is done by the browser's JavaScript engine (e.g., `V8` in Chrome, `SpiderMonkey` in Firefox)

---

### Style Computation

Once CSSOM is ready, the DOM and CSSOM are combined into the Render Tree, or Computed Style tree, for all visible content (e.g., no head, no nodes with style `display:none`).

*Rendering* is the overall process to go from DOM and CSSOM to drawing on the screen, and includes the Style, Layout, Paint and Composite steps.

---

Updating the Render Tree, or Style, has to be done every time an element is added to the DOM, or styles of an element are changed by JavaScript.

--- 

### Layout

Layout is placing the nodes based on the screen size and resolution. The Layout step determines the positioning of nodes with respect to the viewport based on their height, width and other geometry. 

---

The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` tag will set the width to the actual device instead of the default 960px. 

---

The Layout step happens every time the placement needs to be recalculated. 

The more nodes that move, the longer it takes. 

---

Excessive **Layout** recalculations during animations can cause *jank* (under 60FPS responsiveness). 

*Reflow* refers to the Layout, Paint and Composite steps being repeated.

JavaScript can trigger extra reflow on top of what's done by the browser once
per frame: __forced synchronous reflow__. Bad!

---

### Paint and Composite

The **Paint** step paints the pixels. Initially, the entire screen is painted, but after that only impacted areas are repainted. 

**Compositing** ensures that the layers are drawn in the correct order.

---

### Match the following

Indicate if these cause Layout to be redone or not.

1. Change a style of an element to `display:none`
2. Add an advertising header once the main content has loaded ([example](https://www.lapresse.ca/))
3. Change the background colour of a node
4. Change the border width of a node
5. Change the style of an element to `visibility:hidden`
6. Change a rule from `p { width: 500px }` to `section .someclass { width: 500px }`

---

#### Answers

1. yes, layout needs to be redone since an element is removed from the document layout
2. yes, the advertising header will move everything below, causing layout to be recalculated. If the banner moves in and out in an animation, it will cause reflow and may result in jank.
3. No, this requires Paint, but no layout
4. yes, the width impacts the space taken by the node
5. `visibility` shows or hides an element without changing the layout, so the layout step is not done
6. Layout will be redone - the CSSOM changed so Layout will be redone

---

## Reflow

A layout change means that the placement needs to be recalculated for all elements that are affected.

Styles causing layout changes include: width, position, margin, etc...

The browser has to check the impact on other elements.

Any affected area is repainted and final painted elements are composited back together

## Paint-Composite only changes

Some style changes don't cause Layout to be recalculated, for example, color or background.

In this case, the affected areas are repainted and the final painted elements are composited back together.

## Impact of styles

[This site](https://csstriggers.com/) indicates which styles cause layout, paint, and/or composite changes.

::: notes

* metrics like the timing of `load` or `DOMContentLoaded` don't necessarily 
  correspond to what the user sees on their screen.

* Largest Contentful Paint ([LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-is-lcp)) < 2.5s
  * render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport

::: notes

* LCP is an estimate of user-centric _perceived_ load speed
  * "because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's 
    main content has likely loadedâ€”a fast LCP helps reassure the user that 
    the page is useful."

* First Input Delay ([FID](https://web.dev/fid/)) < 100ms
  * the time from when a user first interacts with a page (i.e. when they click a link)  
    when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers

::: notes

* FID is an estimate of your user's impression of your site's interactivity 
  and responsiveness.

* Cumulative Layout Shift ([CLS](https://web.dev/cls/#what-is-cls)), the lower the better
  * how often users see _unexpected_ layout shifts

::: notes

* CLS: "Note that layout shifts only occur when existing elements change 
their _start_ position"
  * A layout shift is only bad if the user isn't expecting it (it's not triggered
  by user interaction)
  * "Unexpected movement of page content usually happens because resources are 
  loaded asynchronously or DOM elements get dynamically added to the page 
  above existing content. The culprit might be an image or video with unknown dimensions,..."
